# Knock-Lock

Idea
Our project is a knock activated secret compartment in a bookshelf. The idea is to have a safe and hidden hiding place for the sake of privacy. The added aspect is that it doesnt have a physical key but is rather opened by a specific sequence of knocks. 

Problem Statement
A traditional safe using a lock and key to open has many problems
It is conspicuous
The keys are easy to lose
Copies of keys can be made
Keys can be stolen
It cannot be completely hidden

SDG's in play
9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastricture
11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities

Constraints

The secret compartment has to be concealed.
The compartment has to be strong.
The lock should not be breakable.
The lock should be consistent. 
The container must be large enough to contain the circuit and a safe.


Final Solution

Name of the Solution
Knock Lock

Design Process
The design would be a secret compartment concealed by a bookshelf. The compartment would contain the lock circuit which would unlock a bolt holding the bookshelf and compartment together. The casing is made of 12mm plywood. 

Materials used
12mm Plywood
Breadboard
LED's
Servo Motor
Piezo Sensor
Arduino Nano
Jumper Wires
Resistors
Bolt Lock

Machines Used
Solder
Jigsaw
Drill
3D printer

Skill Used
We used a variety of skills in completing our project. We used skills learnt in electronics, PCB and CAD sessions online to build the circuit and solder the parts together. The electronics skills were used to alter our code and for the extensive debugging it required. We used PCB skills to design the circuit and solder components together. Along with this, we used the woodworking, 3d printing and laser cutting skills that we learnt in person. The skills we learnt to use the drills, jigsaw, saws and sanding machines were what we used to build the outer case for our circuit. In our prototype stage, we also 3d printed cases covering the lock in the secret compartment.

Challenges faced and solutions
We faced many problems with our code in the journey to making this project. Our reference code was quite complicated and it took a long time to understand. Despite that, we found we didnt fully understand the working of the piezo sensor which was the main part of our project. We also had to eliminate the use of the push button because it did not make sense with our project. These changes resultes in the need for a lot of debugging of the code. Another issue we faced was with the locking mechanism. Initially, we had a smooth working lock, but it went missing and we werent able to acquire another that would work so well. We had also 3D printed parts which only fit the other lock. We pivoted to many different solution including laser cutting and 3D printing the whole thing. But in the end we decided to simplify it and rather than a bolt lock we made a simple U shaped lock out of wood.
